I created my web portfolio using bootstrap framework instead of doing everything by scratch in HTML and CSS. I find it very difficult to use html and CSS. I need a lot more practise with it before I'll be able to bend it to my will. I think I'm leaning in other directions of media and design and I think bootstrap would be able to serve me well in the future. I feel like I can at the very least understand what code is now doing which is nice, and I hope to get some more experience tweaking things on a wordpress site or some other CMS. I quite like that bootstrap is basically just a CMS without a graphical interface. You don't need to remember every tiny little detail, like having perfect padding on everything and understanding how it will affect all the other elements within the style sheet. I found the resources on the bootstrap site very helpful and there's a guy on youtube called webdevelopment ed who I enjoy. All of the media is my own.
